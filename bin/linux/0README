The  `carma.v.2.3.run`  file is a self-extracting archive which will 
install everything in /usr/local/ . To install the programs as root
in /usr/local/ , give from the unix shell :


                       sudo ./carma.v.2.3.run



_____________________________________________________________________

If you do not have root privileges, you can extract the files locally
using the formalism 

                   ./carma.v.2.3.run --target <DIR>

The file `install.sh` has the instructions for what needs to go where.

Do *not* copy the files blindly in the path : the cwords directory 
contains a file named 'merge' (which may create problems with the 
linux command of the same name).
