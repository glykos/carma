Install all three executable files (carma, cluster5D, grcarma) in the
same directory in the path (for example, /usr/local/bin). 

____________________________________________________________________________


The carma executable was cross-compiled on a GNU/Linux machine and has been
tested on a Snow Leopard machine. This is a complete executable with
graphics and LAPACK, I have tested it on one single machine that I had
limited access to, _but_ I do not own a MacOSX machine and I do not have a
clue as to how portable it is.


The executable was produced with :

/usr/i686-apple-darwin9/bin/i686-apple-darwin9-gcc -DGRA \
 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 \
 -I/usr/i686-apple-darwin9/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin9/4.0.1/include \
 -IYgl-4.2_MachO_i686 -L/usr/i686-apple-darwin9/usr/X11R6/lib \
 -LYgl-4.2_MachO_i686 Color_carma.c -lYgl -lXext -lX11 -llapack -lblas -lm

(ignore site-specific paths in the above).
