The automatic installers (32 or 64 bit) will install carma, 
grcarma and cluster5D and is possibly the easiest way
to get going on windows machines.


___________________________________________________________________


The stand alone carma executable provided in this directory
was cross-compiled on a GNU/Linux machine using wingw32 and it
has been tested under windows XP. The executable was produced
with something like

gcc -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DWINDOWS -fstack-check -Wall -pedantic \
    -Wl,--stack,67108864 -O Color_carma.c -lm

and it uses numerical recipes' eigen-routines. 

The easiest (only ?) way to use the program on windows is
via the MS-DOS prompt. Needless to say that this executable
does not have graphics support.
