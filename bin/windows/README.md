# carma & friends on windows
____________________________________________________________________


Windows 11 (through WSL2) fully supports a linux graphics environment.  The
implication is that through WSL2 you can run the linux carma/grcarma/cluster5D
executables together with all supportive programs (stride, evince, rasmol,
...), at near native speeds. The way things are, there is no reason for messing
with the native windows builds (which have significant limitations). Just
install WSL2, and use the fully functional linux executables.
