For building a fully-fledged executable (with graphics
and eigenroutines), have a look at the description 
provided in the program's man or html pages [in the
doc/ subdirectory of the distribution], or better still
the 0README files in the various bin/ subdirectories.


For more mundane buildings (without graphics and 
possibly without eigenroutines) keep reading.

	 COMPILATION WITHOUT EIGEN-ROUTINES

If you do not have LAPACK on your disk, and you do not
want to install LAPACK on your machine, and you do not
need the eigen routines anyway, edit the source code 
and change 

#define         LAPACK      1
#undef          NR

to

#undef          LAPACK
#undef          NR

Then doing a :

cc -O carma.c -lm

should suffice.

/*****************************************************/

	      COMPILATION WITH LAPACK

cc -O -c carma.c
f77 -O carma.o -llapack -lblas -lm

,or,

gcc -O -c carma.c
g77 -O carma.o -llapack -lblas -lm


This trick (using the FORTRAN compiler for the linking
step) may not work on some machines. For example, under
OSF you may need to use something like :

cc -newc -fast -arch generic -tune generic carma.c \
   -llapack -lblas -lUfor -lfor -lFutil -lm -lots -lc
   

/*****************************************************/

	  COMPILATION WITH NUMERICAL RECIPES

If you have access to the numerical recipes' library 
or subroutines, you can use them instead of the LAPACK 
library. To do this edit the source code and change 

#define         LAPACK      1
#undef          NR

to

#undef          LAPACK
#define         NR	    1

Then doing a :

gcc -O carma.c -lnr -lm

should suffice (if the numerical recipes' library is 
libnr.a).

If you do not have the library, but you have the 
source code, then you need to copy and paste the 
following subroutines in the source code : 

		eigsrt() 
		tred2() 
		tqli() 
		pythag()
